// Package i6p provides a library implementation of the I6P (IPv6 Peer-to-Peer Protocol) building blocks.
//
// I6P is designed as a connectivity/transport layer for IPv6-only peer-to-peer applications.
// It provides cryptographic peer identity (Ed25519), modular discovery interfaces, and a QUIC-based
// encrypted transport with a session handshake that binds connections to the peer identity.
